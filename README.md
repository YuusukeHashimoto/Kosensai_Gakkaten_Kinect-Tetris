# Tetris-Kinect

Source code for a game produced by the Nara-Kosen Festival in 2017.

[Unity](https://unity.com/ja), a game engine, and [Kinect](https://developer.microsoft.com/ja-jp/windows/kinect/), a motion capture device, were used in the production of this game.

# Environment
Sorry, but the source code of the game made in 2017 at the Nara-Kosen Festival was uploaded in 2020, so the detailed environment and other details are unknown.

# How to play
The basic content is the same as the original Tetris. The only difference is that the blocks are controlled by the movement of your right arm.

## Basic posture
Stand upright, with your right arm pointing straight ahead!
Don`t use your left hand, so keep it on your hip.

## Basic operation
(1) Right arm upward ⇒ Block rotates counterclockwise
There is no clockwise rotation.
2) Right arm to the right => Block moves to the right.
③ Right arm to left ⇒ Block moves to left
(4) Right arm downward ⇒ Block will fall faster
